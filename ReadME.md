# For Players

## Description

Cryptids Online is a digital adaptation of the popular board game, Cryptids. This online version allows players to experience the thrill of hunting for elusive creatures from the comfort of their own homes. Engage in strategic deduction and exploration with friends or other players worldwide, as you each strive to be the first to uncover the hidden cryptid's location. Whether you're a seasoned player or new to the game, Cryptids Online offers a captivating and interactive gameplay experience.


## Gameplay Overview

In Cryptids Online, each player takes on the role of a cryptozoologist, racing to locate a mysterious creature known as the cryptid. The game revolves around collecting and analyzing clues to narrow down the possible locations of the cryptid. Players use logic and deduction to interpret these clues and make strategic moves on the map. The first player to correctly identify the cryptid's location wins the game.

### Key Actions

1. **Explore**: Move your token to different locations on the map to gather clues.
2. **Deduce**: Use the clues you've collected to rule out impossible locations.
3. **Challenge**: If you think you know where the cryptid is hiding, issue a challenge and see if you're correct!


# For developers
## File and Code Structure

### General

#### Naming Convention

- We will be using a snake naming convention for variables (e.g. num_users)
  - Motivation: [CamelCase vs. Under_score](https://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf)

#### Comments

1. Comments should be clear.
2. Each file should contain a multi-line comment at the beginning of the file indicating the type of file (component, service, model, etc.).
3. Follow the following comment outline:

| // -- ToDo: ____ | Outline something that still needs to be completed in the file code |
| --- | --- |
| /* Function â€¦. */ | Multi-line comment above function definitions to outline what the function does. Should like similar to multi-line comment @ beginning of file |
| // -- xyz | 1-liner comment to outline a patch of code below it |

### Frontend

#### File Structure

- The code should be structured in a nested folder-file system. Files will be in camel-case naming convention.


The application will have the following folders:

1. Components
    - Contains React component .js files

2. Styles
    - Contains .css files for each component

3. Services
    - Contains .js files that specifically access APIs or produce functional code that does not interfere with a component directly

4. Models
    - Contains .js files that are data models for required objects

5. Pages
    - React component .js files that are specifically pages

## GitHub Branch Naming
